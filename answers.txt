Advantages of Containers over Virtual Machines:

1. Resource Efficiency: Containers consume fewer resources than virtual machines, leading to better resource 
                        utilization and lower infrastructure costs.
2. Faster Startup Time: Containers can be started up and shut down much more quickly than virtual machines, 
                        leading to improved agility and responsiveness.

Disadvantages of Containers over Virtual Machines:

1. Security Concerns: Containers share the host operating system kernel, potentially exposing all containers to vulnerabilities.
2. Limited Isolation: Containers share some resources with the host system and other containers, which can lead to compatibility issues and 
                      difficulty enforcing strict resource limits or network isolation.

RUN: Executes a command during the build process to install dependencies, configure settings, or perform other tasks.
